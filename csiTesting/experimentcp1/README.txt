Experiment 1: Testing for the diversity of CSI data received in different positions in the room.
Bag files are titled as CSI_$x_$y_$z.bag.
For example, a bag for when the receiver's position was (-2, 3, 0) would be CSI_-2_3_0.bag
The origin (0, 0, 0) was located under the table for this experiment.
